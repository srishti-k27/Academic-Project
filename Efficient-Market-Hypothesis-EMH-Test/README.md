# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) Test — Econometric Analysis

**Objective:**  
Test whether 2014 firm-specific factors could predict stock returns from 2015–2018 using OLS regression.

**Approach:**   
- Applied OLS regression with explanatory variables from 2014 and returns from 2015–2018.  
- Validated econometric assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity, no autocorrelation).  

**Findings:**  
- Results supported the Random Walk Hypothesis, consistent with EMH.
