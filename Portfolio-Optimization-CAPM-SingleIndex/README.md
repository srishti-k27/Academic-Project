Portfolio Optimization & Risk-Return Analysis (CAPM & Single-Index Model)
Applied the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate expected returns and beta for selected assets, then designed an optimized portfolio using the Single-Index Model and Minimum Variance approach.

Highlights:
- Maximized the Sharpe Ratio through data-driven asset allocation.
- Integrated CAPM estimates into the Single-Index optimization framework.
- Used quantitative analysis to determine optimal asset weights.
