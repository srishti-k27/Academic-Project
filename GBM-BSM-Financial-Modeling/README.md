# GBM & BSM Financial Modeling

**Objective:**  
Simulate stock price trajectories using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and evaluate European options with the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model.

**Approach:**  
- Implemented GBM simulation for mid-cap Indian stocks.  
- Validated assumptions using ADF and Ljung-Box statistical tests.  
- Compared simulated vs. actual prices using Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
- Built an Excel-based BSM calculator for European options under varying market conditions.
